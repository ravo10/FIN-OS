# FIN OS Tool (FIN OPEN SOURCE)

### How to use:
* You can find the stand alone tool under: ***Weapons => ravo Norway => Fin OS Tool***
* **Left-Click to apply** single 3 - 6 vector points on prop, to get started. This will calculate the area using the length of the cross products
* **Reload to remove** fin from prop

### How it works:
* It uses **real physics** to calculate lift from the center of the prop, and real life formula for calculating lift
* *Force[LIFT] = .5 * rho[AIR] * Velocity[m/s]^2 * Area[m^2] * C[L - angle of attack]*

### Features:
* Supports duplication
* Supports clean up
* Supports SBOX max
