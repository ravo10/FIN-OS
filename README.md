# FIN OS Tool (FIN OPEN SOURCE)

### How to use:
* You can find the stand alone tool under: ***Weapons => ravo Norway => Fin OS Tool***
* **Left-Click to apply** single 3 - 6 vector points on prop, to get started. This will calculate the area using the length of the cross products
* **Reload to remove** fin from prop

### How it works:
* It uses **real physics** to calculate lift from the center of the prop, and real life formula for calculating lift
* *Force[LIFT] = .5 * rho[AIR] * Velocity[m/s]^2 * Area[m^2] * C[L - angle of attack]*

### Features:
* Supports duplication
* Supports clean up
* Supports SBOX max

## BETA
### 0.0.1 ( 28.03.21 )
- Basic functionality
### 0.0.2 ( 28.03.21 )
- Added custom model, spawn icon and menu icon for SWEP tool
- Added a visual way to view the area of the wing
- Added a visual way to see if any vectors are crossing eachother
- Added so you can have as many vector points as the alphabeth is long ( could be infinite )
- Fixed bugs
- Cleaned up and improved code
### 0.0.3 ( 28.03.21 )
- Added a way to adjust the scalar [ 1 - 369 ] for lift ( IN_USE + SCROLL_WHEEL )
- Added so the player can view the current scalar for the lift in the default pop-up settings panel
- Added so the player can Right-Click to view/hide a panel that shows the wing's current speed and attack angle

## @todo
- Add flap logic
